Hipchat emoticon set for Adium & Pidgin!
----------------------------------------

To use:

Check out this repository on your Mac or Linux box, and...

Pidgin for Linux/UNIX: Run the included script: ``build-pidgin-theme.sh``

It will create the "theme" folder for you under the Hipchat.AdiumEmoticonSet
directory and prompt you to move it to the correct location using sudo.

Adium OSX: The "Hipchat.AdiumEmoticonSet" folder should show up as a bundle
if you have Adium installed. Just double-click on it (or open it using 
``/usr/bin/open``).

Alternatively, download the pack from `Adium Extras`_. Note that the Adium
Extras pack will tend to lag behind this repository.
